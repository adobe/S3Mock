# PLANNED - 5.x - RELEASE TBD
Version 5.x is JDK17 LTS bytecode compatible (maybe JDK25 LTS, depending on the release date), with Docker integration.

Any JUnit / direct Java usage support will most likely be dropped and only supported on a best-effort basis.
(i.e., the modules will be deleted from the code base and not released anymore. It *may* be possible to
still run S3Mock directly in Java.)
The S3Mock is a Spring Boot application and currently contains various workarounds to make it possible
to easily to run `S3MockApplication#start` from a static context. These workarounds will be deleted.

Running S3Mock in unit tests is still supported by using [TestContainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/).

**Once 5.x is released, 4.x may receive bug fixes and features. This will be best-effort only.**

## Planned changes

* Features and fixes
  * TBD
* Refactorings
  * Looking to Remove unit test modules. This enables
    * Refactoring S3Mock to a "standard" Spring Boot application.
    * Removal of workarounds to use `S3MockApplication#start` from a static context
  * Migration to `Kotlin` - the IntegrationTests and unit tests were migrated already.
* Version updates
  * TBD

## 5.0.0 - PLANNED

* Features and fixes
  * Get object with range now returns the same headers as non-range calls.
* Refactorings
  * Use Jackson 3 annotations and mappers.
  * AWS has deprecated SDK for Java v1 and will remove support EOY 2025.
    * Remove Java SDK v1.
  * JUnit 4.x deprecation
    * Remove JUnit 4.x support.
  * Remove legacy properties for S3Mock configuration.
  * Move all controller-related code from "com.adobe.testing.s3mock" to com.adobe.testing.s3mock.controller package.
* Version updates
  * Bump Spring Boot version to 4.x
  * Bump Spring Framework version to 7.x
  * Bump java version from 17 to 25
    * S3Mock will use the baseline Spring chooses to support.
    * The Docker container will run Java 25 LTS.

# CURRENT - 4.x - THIS VERSION IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

    * Previous implementation returned a Spring generated error which does not disclose what's actually wrong
    * If the bucket name is not valid, the bucket can't be created. If a later request still contains this invalid name, S3Mock will now return a 404 not found.

## 2.10.1
2.x is JDK8 LTS bytecode compatible, with Docker and JUnit / direct Java integration.

* Features and fixes
  * Let S3Mock use streams for MD5 verification (fixes #939)
    * Previous implementation read the full stream into memory, leading to OutOfMemory errors if the file is larger than the available heap.

2.x is JDK8 LTS bytecode compatible, with Docker and JUnit / direct Java integration.

* Features and fixes
  * Avoid root folder temporary directory race condition (fixes #837)
    * Thanks to @ginkel for the fix!

## 2.7.0
2.x is JDK8 LTS bytecode compatible, with Docker and JUnit / direct Java integration.

* Features and fixes
  * Add support for ACL APIs (fixes #213 / #290)
    * Implement GetObjectACL / PutObjectACL
    * Return / accept String instead of a POJO. We need to use JAX-B annotations instead of Jackson annotations
      because AWS decided to use xsi:type annotations in the XML representation, which are not supported
      by Jackson. It doesn't seem to be possible to use bot JAX-B and Jackson for (de-)serialization in parallel.
* Version updates
  * Bump aws-java-sdk-s3 from 1.12.298 to 1.12.309
  * Bump aws-v2.version from 2.17.269 to 2.17.281

    * Fixes ETag handling in GetObject, HeadObject, CopyObject, UploadPartCopy APIs.
    * We are now generating and storing ETags in the "RFC-Format" with enclosing double quotes.
    * Incoming ETags are used verbatim to compare against the internally held representation.
    * Wildcard ETags are also correctly handled.

## 2.6.2
2.x is JDK8 LTS bytecode compatible, with Docker and JUnit / direct Java integration.

* Features and fixes
  * LastModified must be updated when copying an object onto itself (fixes #811)
* Refactorings
  * Split up integration tests by type

## 2.6.1
2.x is JDK8 LTS bytecode compatible, with Docker and JUnit / direct Java integration.

* Features and fixes
  * ETags in requests and responses must comply to RFC-2616 (fixes #801) 
    * Fixes `ListObjects` and `ListObjectsV2` APIs.
    * Whenever S3Mock uses Serialization / Deserialization with Jackson, we  must use our custom 
      EtagSerializer / EtagDeserializer that wraps and unwraps the etag for the DTO.
* Version updates
  * Bump aws-v2.version from 2.17.267 to 2.17.269
  * Bump aws-java-sdk-s3 from 1.12.296 to 1.12.298

## 2.6.0
* Features and fixes
  * Add support for LegalHold APIs (fixes #157)
    * Implement GetObjectLegalHold / PutObjectLegalHold
    * Implement GetObjectLockConfiguration / PutObjectLockConfiguration
    * In S3, object locking can only be activated for versioned buckets, versions are currently not supported by S3Mock.
      S3 enforces LegalHold only for versions, so S3Mock currently can't enforce the legal hold.
  * Add support for Retention APIs
    * Implement GetObjectRetention / PutObjectRetention
    * In S3, object locking can only be activated for versioned buckets, versions are currently not supported by S3Mock.
      S3 enforces retention only for versions, so S3Mock currently can't enforce the retention.
* Refactorings
  * Added support for IntegrationTests to use a dedicated bucket per test method
    * Refactored some IntegrationTests to this pattern.
  * Use AWS SDK internal Utils for instants and encoding
    * Using `software.amazon.awssdk.utils.DateUtils` and `software.amazon.awssdk.utils.http.SdkHttpUtils`
    * These classes are marked as `software.amazon.awssdk.annotations.SdkProtectedApi`
      which means that SDK users (liek S3Mock) should not use these classes, but S3Mock has to exactly match the
      behaviour and expectations of the AWS SDKs, and it's easier to depend on internal AWS SDK classes
      instead of replicating or copying the code.
    * S3Mock may have violated the AWS SDK license before by including source code without explicitly
      stating that it's AWS copyrighted code. (In the JavaDoc it did say that this is a copy with
      a reference to the class, though)
* Version updates
  * Bump aws-v2.version from 2.17.263 to 2.17.267
  * Bump aws-java-sdk-s3 from 1.12.292 to 1.12.296

## 2.5.4
* Features and fixes
  * Rename local storage files, add file system structure documentation to README.md (fixes #220)
  * `@Configuration` / `@ConfigurationProperties` classes now public to enable customers to use `@Import` / `@ContextConfiguration` on them. (fixes #751)

## 2.5.3
* Features and fixes
  * Remove [Spring Component Index](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-scanning-index) from S3Mock (fixes #786)
    * Adding a Spring Component Index file is a breaking change for all clients of the s3mock.jar
    * If Spring finds even one Component Index file in the classpath, all other configuration in the application 
      is completely ignored by default.

## 2.5.2
* Features and fixes
  * Correctly detect and use existing root folder (fixes #786)

## 2.5.1
* Features and fixes
  * Use `@SpringBootApplication` to configure S3Mock (fixes #782)

## 2.5.0
* Features and fixes
  * Add [Spring Component Index](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-scanning-index) to S3Mock (fixes #751)
  * Bucket lifecycle
    * S3Mock now validates incoming Bucket names.
      * S3 SDKs (for Java) validated the names before sending, so this should not matter for most use-cases.
    * S3Mock now throws errors on duplicate creation (409 Conflict) / deletion (404 Not Found)
      * These errors are defined in the S3 API, the S3Mock just never implemented them.
  * DTOs
    * Fix names, methods, return values to match AWS API
    * Remove internal field "path" from `Bucket` serializations. Fortunately this did not break AWS SDKs in the past, since the "path" field is not expected in those responses.
  * Various other fixes like
    * Removal of duplicated / simplification of code where possible
    * Add (hopefully useful?) logging with all incoming parameters on errors.
    * Fix IntelliJ IDEA warnings
    * Better assertions in tests
    * Fix various JavaDoc issues, add links to S3 API where possible
* Refactorings
  * Major refactoring towards smaller classes with well-defined responsibilities.
    * Many of the existing lines of code in the S3Mock core were changed, moved or removed.
    * All IntegrationTests were/are still green, HTTP API did not change (other than fixed listed above)
  * Refactor into layers `Controller -> Service -> Store`
    * Controllers handle request/response only, Services implement higher level functionality on top of their stores, Stores read and write data from/to disk.
    * Handle Multipart requests in `MultipartController` -> `MultipartService` -> `MultipartStore`
    * Handle Bucket requests in `BucketController` -> `BucketService` -> `BucketStore`
    * Handle Object requests in `ObjectController` -> `ObjectService` -> `ObjectStore`
    * Code and documentation cleanup
    * Let `BucketStore` store `BucketMetadata` just like `S3ObjectMetadata` locally. For now, only store the "core" metadata like creationDate and name.
    * Store object keys in `BucketMetadata`, assign UUIDs (fixes #94)
    * Store objects in UUID folders, clean up name usage
  * Extract header helper methods into `HeaderUtil` from `FileStoreController` / `ObjectController`.
