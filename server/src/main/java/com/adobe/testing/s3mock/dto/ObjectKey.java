 * Key request value object.
 * Removes the trailing slash extracted from paths by Spring.
 * Used in conjunction with the PathVariable extracted by using "{*key}" in the path pattern.
 * See {@link org.springframework.web.util.pattern.PathPattern}
 * Example path pattern: "/{bucketName:.+}/{*key}"
 * Example incoming path: "/my-bucket/prefix/before/my/key"
 * By declaring "{*key}", Spring extracts the absolute path "/prefix/before/my/key", but in S3, all
 * keys within a bucket are relative to the bucket, in this example "prefix/before/my/key".
